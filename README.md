# Arduino Controlling a DC Motor Using H-Bridge
## Introduction
This project involves controlling a DC motor using an Arduino Uno and an H-Bridge (L293D). The motor's speed and direction are controlled through the Arduino based on input from two push buttons.

## Components:
1. Arduino Uno
2. H-Bridge L293D
3. DC Motor
4. Push Buttons (2)
5. Breadboard
6. Connecting Wires
